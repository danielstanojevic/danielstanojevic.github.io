      what's your take on the DBC experience?

      The first week is a bit hectic trying to get used to all the tools and procedures while trying to learn the material at the same time.  But, it's manageable.  Just make sure you make enough time to complete everything.   I like the emphasis placed on community.

        What is your impression of DBC?

        So far so good.  I really appreciate the effort they put in to consider the whole learning experience, including things like meditation.

        How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?

        I think it's great to pair with others.  It's such a great way to share knowledge and learn new things.  I have the privilege of being in a pairing group started by a DBC alum, and it's a great experience.

      Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how?

      No, they haven't.  I was expecting a challenging, yet informative course and so far, that's what it has been.

      Yes, I look forward to pair program with other individuals that are as interested and focused on learning as I am.

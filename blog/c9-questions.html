    <p>
      I first asked questions in IRC back in the day.  Initially, I recieved a
      lot of follow up questions.  I quickly learned that I needed to be much
      more specific when explaining the exact problem I was having.  When asking
      a question in a forum, you should first do your own research to see if a
      solution has already been posted.  This way, you're not wasting everyone's
      time.  Then, if you do post, post as much information as possible, include
      error codes, intention, system environment details, log files, etc.
      Help them, help you.  Be polite.  They're doing you a favor by answering
      your question.

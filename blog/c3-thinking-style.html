      What's my thinking style?

      Abstract Sequential

      According to my thinking style, what's hard for me is having too little time to deal with a subject thoroughly.  I find that especially true in DBC.  However, I've realized that there are effective ways to improve results with proper time management such as time boxing.  My learning style suggests that I prefer to follow a plan, which is true.  Books are organized in this linear fashion, and I do find that I learn effectively following along in a book.

      I definitely have a growth mindset.  I actually took part of the Learning to Learn course that was recommended as an optional resource.  I intend to finish that course to improve my learning style in general.

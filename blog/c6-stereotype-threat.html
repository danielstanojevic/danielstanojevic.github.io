      Stereotype Threat is the theory that a group will perform poorly when their particular diversity is pointed out to them prior to the task being performed.

      Consider how affected your achievement or how it could impact someone else's achievement (if you are not sharing personal experiences)?

      If you don't think you've ever felt it, can you imagine how it would feel to? If you thought others were suffering from it, what could you do to help others in that situation? Can you identify ways to change your behavior or the environment you're in to make it more welcoming and reduce the impact of stereotype threat?

      I can't think of a single person I know that has been affected by it.  I know several people that are classified as a minority in their field that actually outperform most people in their field.  I have a very diverse selection of friends and I don't think this is a problem.  That's all I'm going to say, because I think this is a poor theory.

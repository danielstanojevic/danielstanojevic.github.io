      Pairing:

      What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?

      It's nice to get a different perspective on things as well as instant feedback on ideas and thoughts.


      Was something particularly fun or rewarding?

      In general it's fun to work with other people when doing technical work to maintain the human feel instead of just working completely with the machine.


      Was something frustrating and difficult for you?

      It's sometimes frustrating when another person doesn't agree with the idea I have regarding a possible solution even though their idea is not as efficient or intuitive.

      Feedback:

      How did you feel when you read your feedback?

      Feedback is great because it shows me where I can improve.  Positive feedback is like a pat on the back.  :)

      Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?

      Yes.  I learned at least a few different things.

      Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair?

      I've already taken steps to improve my next pairing session.  One suggestion was to eliminate background activity in my surrounding environment, so I now go to a closed office space when pairing.

      How was it to write feedback?

      I enjoy helping someone improve if possible because I appreciate the same.

      What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?

      It's difficult to be critical without sounding mean, even though that's definitely not my intention.

      Overall, what do you think of using pairing and feedback to guide your learning?

      I think it's definitely benneficial.  I especially appreciate having another perspective on things.

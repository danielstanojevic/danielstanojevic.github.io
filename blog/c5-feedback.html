      Online security

      Online security is composed of many aspects, ranging from human psychology to physics.

      Security is only as good as the weakest point.  Vulnerabilities are discovered on a daily basis, including software that everyone in the world uses and relies on, such as the recent OpenSSL vulnerabilities.

      Human psychology is a factor because people typically can't remember a long difficult password.  They also don't want to change their password frequently.  They also don't want to use different passwords for different systems.  Computers are excellent tools to take advantage of those weaknesses.  Computers can attempt millions of passwords per second, making a password with 8 characters quite trivial.

      Physics plays a part as well.  From using a laser on glass to pick up the vibrations when a user is typing their password to physically tapping into a line to capture data going across a network.  Physical access to a system is just as important as keeping gold safe.  The possibillities are as endless as the creativity of the attacker.

      In between the human and physical aspects, there's also the obvious software aspect.  Buffer overflows are the most common vulnerability, but there are countless others.  While security is being built in to development frameworks, there is still plenty of room for error semantically if nothing else.  Following good software practices and in general being mindful of security when developing software can go a long way.  Encryption should always be used for sensitive data.  A users input should never be trusted and should always be escaped and sanitized.  Don't let the user modify the URL to access other parts of your site.  SQL injection, and Cross Site Scripting are just two of the most common vulnerabilites.  Systems should be regularly scanned for vulnerabilities and compromise.  Not only does the application need to be secure, but the server it's running on has a multitude of security concerns on its own.  Be mindful of open ports, ssh access, ssh root login should be disabled, the server should be running up to date software, a firewall should be in place, etc.  There are vulnerabilites in development frameworks, so be mindful of which version you are using.  There are so many things to consider when thinking about security.  It's nearly impossible to be completely secure, but it's relatively simple to be mostly secure if some effort and knowledge is applied.

      With quantum computing around the corner, we will be vulnerable to much more security issues given the incredible computing power provided by quantum computing.  Our current passwords and encryption could potentially be decrypted in real time with quantum computers.  This is quite dangerous considering how much we rely on our current security measures.  This blgo doesn't even scratch the surface of the security topic as a whole, but it should at least get you to think about the potential issues you may come across as you write software.  Good luck and be safe!
